# SFMLSnake
This is custom snake clone made using SFML C++ library. 
The goal was to simply get used to providing tools and learn to use basic things.

## Compile
This is my study project so I hadn't bothered about third-face compiling.
So you can compile and play unfortunately only using VS, just open the .sln file and use Release\x64.
